<!--Question 1-->
<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/zero/">ZERO: Countdown to Tomorrow, 1950s-60s</a></li>
		Guggenheim Museum, New York</li>
		<p>
		<li><a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.com">Planned Parenthood</a></li>
	</ul>	
	
	
<!--Question 2-->
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
	<p><ul>
	
	<h3>ZERO</h3>
	This website uses a symmetrical system of balance. The main navigation is a circle that fills the entire screen, and it adjusts its size as the user changes the size of the browser window. An image is placed in the center of the circle and corresponds to a node on the circle when the user hovers over it.
	
	<h3>Planned Parenthood</h3>
	This website uses a strong grid structure to create an asymmetrical design. The logo is prominently placed in the upper left area of the screen. Below it is a rotating slideshow with important headlines. The focal point, however, is the dark blue vertical band on the right side of the page. It's contrast against the rest of the page's light-toned design draws the eye to the most important information on the page. 
	</ul></p>

<!--Question 3-->
<h2>What makes them similar or different?</h2>
	<p><ul>
	These two websites couldn't be more different. 
	<p><strong>ZERO</strong> uses a stark palette of black and white. The only color occurs in the images of artists' works. The navigation is unique because it is a giant circle with nodes along the perimeter. This design is intended to emphasize creativity and unique approaches to art-making. Users are meant to relax and explore.
	<p><strong>Planned Parenthood</strong> uses a more pragmatic grid-based design to organize a lot more information. Users of this website want information that is easy to find and clear. This site also uses complimentary colors (orange and blue) to draw the eye around the composition.

		<strong>My Portfolio Concept 1: Page 1</strong>
		<p>My designs put the logo/header at the top left as the consistent focal point. The secondary focus is the main image filling most of the screen. The composition on the front page is mostly symmetrical, but following pages follow the grid in a more dynamic asymmetrical pattern.

		<strong>My Portfolio Concept 2: One Page</strong>
	<p>My second design also places the logo on the top left side. The primary image balances it on the right side. The left columns have all the navigation elements and options, while the right half of the page displays more open breathing room with large images. There aren't any other pages in this design. It's simple navigation creates ease of use for the user.
