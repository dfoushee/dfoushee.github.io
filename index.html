<body>
<p>I’m an artist and graphic designer, living in Seattle. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I’ve let my web skills lapse as I focused on print design. Now I need to update my skills.</p>
<br>
<h1>Mission</h1>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day start my own design studio, because I like to work directly with clients, and I want to provide the complete package of design and branding services.</p>
